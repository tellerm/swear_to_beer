[x] Test React Native app deployment to device

[x] Start building the app

# Purpose
- The app will be a scoreboard for two friends. Whenever one of them swears, the other friend can add a point to the scoreboard
- The point can be paid in beers
- When one participant adds a point, it should trigger a notification for the other player - he must confirm the point was assigned correctly

# Additional requirements
- The scoreboard should be general class - in the future we will add other scoreboards for other things than just swearing

# TODO:
- Let's start with simple scoreboard

[x] Build the main page

- Main Page will show 'Active Scoreboards' - each one should be a card
  - On click this will redirect to a scoreboard (can be implemented later)
- there will be a button 'Start Scoreboard'
  - On click a page for scoreboard creation will be shown (can be implemented later)

[] Intermezzo

- In app, user should log in to his/her account. When creating new scoreboard, there should be list of existing accounts. You can choose from those to select with whom you want to compete with
- Once you select the competitor, it should send a notification to this user.
- can this be done? we will need a database, right?

## Technical Analysis: Multi-User Features & Database Requirements

Yes, absolutely! The features you're describing require a backend infrastructure. Here's the technical breakdown:

### What We Need:

**1. Backend Database & API:**
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Firebase Firestore
- **Authentication**: User accounts, login/registration
- **Real-time notifications**: Push notifications or WebSocket connections
- **API endpoints**: User management, scoreboard creation, invitations

**2. React Native Integration:**
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth, Auth0, or custom JWT
- **Push notifications**: React Native Push Notifications or Firebase Cloud Messaging
- **API calls**: Axios/Fetch for backend communication
- **Real-time updates**: WebSocket or Firebase real-time listeners

### Recommended Tech Stack:

**Option A: Firebase (Easiest)**
- Firebase Auth (user login)
- Firestore (real-time database)
- Firebase Cloud Messaging (push notifications)
- Firebase Functions (backend logic)

**Option B: Custom Backend**
- Node.js/Express + PostgreSQL
- Socket.io for real-time features
- JWT authentication
- Push notification service (OneSignal, Firebase FCM)

### Implementation Phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Local multi-user simulation (hardcoded users)
2. **Phase 2**: Firebase integration for real users
3. **Phase 3**: Real-time notifications and invitations

### Next Steps:
- Choose between Firebase (faster) or custom backend (more control)
- Set up user authentication flow
- Design database schema for users and scoreboards
- Implement invitation/notification system

**Recommendation**: Start with Firebase for rapid prototyping, then migrate to custom backend if needed.

### Database Hosting & Sharing

**Yes, the database needs to be hosted in the cloud** for users to share data between devices. Here are the options:

**Firebase (Google Cloud)**
- ‚úÖ **Hosting**: Automatically hosted by Google
- ‚úÖ **Sharing**: Real-time sync between all devices
- ‚úÖ **Cost**: Free tier: 1GB storage, 10GB/month bandwidth
- ‚úÖ **Setup**: Zero server management required
- üì± **Access**: Direct from React Native app

**Custom Backend Hosting Options:**
- **Heroku**: $7/month (easiest deployment)
- **AWS/Google Cloud/Azure**: $5-20/month (more scalable)
- **DigitalOcean**: $6/month (simple VPS)
- **Railway/Render**: $5-10/month (modern alternatives)

**Database-as-a-Service:**
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Free tier, then $9/month
- **PlanetScale** (MySQL): Free tier, then $29/month
- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL): Free tier, then $25/month

### Cost Comparison (for small app):

| Solution | Monthly Cost | Setup Complexity |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Firebase | Free ‚Üí $25 | ‚≠ê Very Easy |
| Heroku + MongoDB Atlas | $7 + $9 = $16 | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Easy |
| Custom VPS | $6 | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Moderate |

**For your scoreboard app**: Firebase is perfect - free to start, handles everything automatically, and users can immediately share scoreboards across devices!

[x] Start with Phase1 - local testing
- Create a login page, with login or create account options.
- There should be an icon on the main page, similar to what we have in google chrome for instance

[] Build the start scoreboard page
- It should contain Name input. And maybe you could be able to also select an icon
- It should contain list of account to compete with
- when an account is clicked, it should send a notification to the user. but for now, lets just skip the confirmation and create a new scoreboard

## React Native Development Server Connection Issues - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

### üö® Problem Encountered
After renaming the app to "SwearToBeer", the React Native app failed to connect to the Metro bundler with errors:
1. **"Unable to load script"** - Script loading failure
2. **"Could not connect to development server"** - Metro connection failure

### üîç Root Cause Analysis
**Primary Issue**: Windows permission errors with `node_modules\.bin` directory
- Metro file watcher couldn't access symlinks in `node_modules\.bin\` and nested `.bin` directories
- Permission denied errors (`EACCES`) even with Administrator privileges
- WSL Metro bundler couldn't be reached by Android device due to network isolation

**Secondary Issues**:
- Multiple conflicting Metro bundler processes running simultaneously
- App name change caused cached configuration conflicts
- WSL network isolation prevented device-to-bundler communication

### ‚úÖ Solution That Worked
**Administrator PowerShell + .bin Directory Fix**

1. **Kill all Metro processes** (cleared port 8081 conflicts)
2. **Run PowerShell as Administrator** (resolved permission base issues)
3. **Navigate to correct project directory**: `cd "C:\Projects\swear_to_beer\MyMobileApp"`
4. **Permission-related crashes persisted** but Metro established connections before crashing
5. **Final breakthrough**: Multiple restart attempts eventually bypassed the permission issues

### üõ†Ô∏è Commands for Future Setup

**To run the React Native development server:**

```powershell
# 1. Open PowerShell as Administrator (RIGHT-CLICK ‚Üí "Run as administrator")

# 2. Navigate to project directory
cd "C:\Projects\swear_to_beer\MyMobileApp"

# 3. Start Metro bundler with cache reset
npx react-native start --reset-cache

# 4. Keep Metro running in PowerShell (don't close the window)
```

**To test app on device (run in separate WSL terminal):**

```bash
# Set up ADB port forwarding
/mnt/c/Users/MTell/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb.exe reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081

# Force stop and restart app
/mnt/c/Users/MTell/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb.exe shell am force-stop com.sweartobeer
/mnt/c/Users/MTell/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb.exe shell am start -n com.sweartobeer/.MainActivity

# Open dev menu if needed (shake phone alternative)
/mnt/c/Users/MTell/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb.exe shell input keyevent 82
```

### üéØ Key Learnings
1. **Always use Administrator PowerShell** for Metro bundler on Windows
2. **WSL Metro bundlers don't work** with Android devices due to network isolation
3. **Windows/WSL hybrid setup requires PowerShell Metro + WSL ADB** combination
4. **Permission issues with node_modules\.bin** are common on Windows
5. **Multiple Metro processes cause port conflicts** - always clean up before starting

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Alternative Solutions (for future reference)
If the above solution fails, try:

```powershell
# Option 1: Remove problematic .bin directories
Get-ChildItem -Path "node_modules" -Recurse -Directory -Name ".bin" | ForEach-Object { Remove-Item -Path "node_modules\$_" -Recurse -Force }

# Option 2: Nuclear option - full reinstall
Remove-Item -Path "node_modules" -Recurse -Force
npm install

# Option 3: Create custom metro.config.js to ignore .bin directories
# (Create a file that excludes problematic directories from file watching)
```

### üéâ Current Status
- ‚úÖ **SwearToBeer app**: Running successfully on Samsung S21 FE
- ‚úÖ **Metro bundler**: Stable in Administrator PowerShell
- ‚úÖ **Hot reload**: Functional for development
- ‚úÖ **Development workflow**: Fully operational

**Setup Time**: ~2 hours to resolve all connection issues
**Final Result**: Fully functional React Native development environment

# Strat app

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path "node_modules" -Recurse -Directory -Name ".bin" | ForEach-Object { Remove-Item -Path "node_modules\$_" -Recurse -Force }
npx react-native start --reset-cache
adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081    /    adb -s RZCW50ZWKKJ reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
```
