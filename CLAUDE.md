The project creates a mobile app. The programming language is react-native.

# Purpose
- The app will be a scoreboard for two friends. Whenever one of them swears, the other friend can add a point to the scoreboard
- The point can be paid in beers
- When one participant adds a point, it should trigger a notification for the other player - he must confirm the point was assigned correctly
